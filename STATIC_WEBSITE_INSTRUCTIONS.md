# Static Website Source Code Instructions

To prepare the static website source code for submission, follow these steps:

1. Build the React project:
   - Open a terminal in your project root directory
   - Run the following command:
     \`\`\`
     npm run build
     \`\`\`
   - This will create a \`build\` or \`out\` directory with static files

2. Copy the contents of the \`build\` or \`out\` directory to a new folder named \`static_website\`

3. Your \`static_website\` folder should now contain:
   - HTML file(s)
   - CSS file(s) in a \`css\` directory
   - JavaScript file(s) in a \`js\` directory
   - Any other assets (images, fonts, etc.) in their respective directories

4. Zip the \`static_website\` folder:
   - Right-click on the \`static_website\` folder
   - Select "Compress" or "Send to > Compressed (zipped) folder"
   - Name the zip file \`static_website_source_code.zip\`

5. Your \`static_website_source_code.zip\` file is now ready for submission

Note: The static website may not function fully without a backend server. It serves as a representation of the front-end code structure and assets.
